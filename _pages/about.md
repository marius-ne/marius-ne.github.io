**Welcome to my Website!**
======
Here you will find information about my various professionnal activites as well as additionnal things I would like to share with the world. The goal for this site is to be a storage of things I created that I think are worth sharing. 

This website is adapted from the Academic Pages Github pages template. Check them out here for further information: [Academic Pages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io). The open-source repository of this website can be found [here](https://github.com/marius-ne/marius-ne.github.io).


For more info
------
More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
