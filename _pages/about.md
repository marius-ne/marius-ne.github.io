**Welcome to my Website!**
======
This website is my place for sharing interesting stuff.

Feel free to have a look around and contact me if something sparks your curiosity!

*This website is adapted from the Academic Pages Github pages template. Check them out here for further information: [Academic Pages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io). The open-source repository of this website can be found [here](https://github.com/marius-ne/marius-ne.github.io).*



<!--
For more info
------
More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
